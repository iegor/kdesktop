"The Samba and NFS Status Monitor is a front end to the programs <em>"
"smbstatus</em> and <em>showmount</em>. Smbstatus reports on current Samba "
"connections, and is part of the suite of Samba tools, which implements the SMB "
"(Session Message Block) protocol, also called the NetBIOS or LanManager "
"protocol. This protocol can be used to provide printer sharing or drive sharing "
"services on a network including machines running the various flavors of "
"Microsoft Windows."
"<p> Showmount is part of the NFS software package. NFS stands for Network File "
"System and is the traditional UNIX way to share directories over the network. "
"In this case the output of <em>showmount -a localhost</em> "
"is parsed. On some systems showmount is in /usr/sbin, check if you have "
"showmount in your PATH."
