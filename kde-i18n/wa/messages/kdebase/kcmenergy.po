"<h1>Display Power Control</h1> If your display supports power saving features, "
"you can configure them using this module."
"<p> There are three levels of power saving: standby, suspend, and off. The "
"greater the level of power saving, the longer it takes for the display to "
"return to an active state."
"<p> To wake up the display from a power saving mode, you can make a small "
"movement with the mouse, or press a key that is not likely to cause any "
"unintentional side-effects, for example, the \"Shift\" key."
