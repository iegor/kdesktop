"In order to find the lyrics for the current song, this plugin uses the "
"properties stored with each song, such as its title, author and album. These "
"properties are usually retrieved by a tag reader, but in some cases they may "
"not be present or be incorrect. In that case, the Lyrics plugin will not be "
"able to find the lyrics until these properties are fixed (you can fix them "
"using the tag editor).\n"
"Hint: The lucky tag plugin, present in the kdeaddons module, can try to guess "
"properties such as title and author from the filename of a song. Enabling it "
"may increase the probability of finding lyrics."
