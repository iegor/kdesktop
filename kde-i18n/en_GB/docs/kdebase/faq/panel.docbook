<answer>
<para

<filename
>$<envar
>HOME</envar
>/.kde/share/apps/kicker/pics/go.png</filename
> and
<filename
>$<envar
>HOME</envar
>/.kde/share/apps/kicker/pics/mini/go.png</filename>

layer, or else you will not see anything.  Create the folders if
they do not already exist.  Then restart &kicker;.</para>

<question
><para
>My desktop panel has disappeared. How can I get it back?</para>
</question>

<answer>

<para
>The panel disappearing is usually due to it crashing. This is most often caused by loading an applet that has a fatal bug or due to a bad installation of &kde; and/or the panel.</para>

<para
>The easiest way to get the panel back is to launch the <guilabel
>Run Command</guilabel
> window by pressing <keycombo action="simul"
>&Alt;<keycap
>F2</keycap
> </keycombo
> and entering <userinput
><command
>kicker</command
></userinput
> and then pressing the <guibutton
>OK</guibutton
> button.</para>

<para
>If the panel continues to disappear, you may wish to either remove or edit by hand your <filename
>$<envar
>KDEHOME</envar
>/share/config/kickerrc</filename
> file, where <filename class="directory"
>$<envar
>KDEHOME</envar
></filename
> is usually <filename class="directory"
>~/.kde</filename
>. If you choose to edit it by hand, start by removing the applet entry groups.</para>
