"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quanta Plus would not be what it is today without sponsored "
"developers. Andras Mantia has been full time since mid 2002 and Michal Rudolf "
"came on part time in spring of 2004. Over the life of the project development "
"has been largely sponsored by the efforts of the Project Manager, Eric Laffoon. "
"In addition to his minimum 10-20 hour a week time commitment, his company, <a "

"LLP has an ongoing financial commitment to keep Quanta in continuous "

"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kitty Hooch is a small company with no employees, 2 "
"active partners and several contract workers. After test marketing in the fall "
"of 2001 they began wholesale and retail to national and international markets "
"in early 2002. Kitty Hooch controls all aspects of their product production and "
"marketing. Quanta sponsorship is no small expense for a small start up company. "
"In 2003 cash flow and a bout with typhoid fever left Eric in debt and unable to "
"keep up payments to Andras without help from the community. Thankfully a number "
"of people stepped up. We now have several large sponsors along with a number of "
"generous contributors. This has enabled us to bring Michal on part time. Now we "

"<h3>Balancing open source ideals and fiscal\n"

"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the open source model\n"

"source projects that we had high hopes for are unmaintained today? In early "
"2002 many people thought that Quanta Plus was dead. One person, Eric Laffoon, "
"was not about to let the dream die. Quanta is more than surviving now, but "
"developing a best-in-class tool is no easy task. We believe the key is "
"consistent momentum. Nothing ensures this better than programmers who can work "
"without financial or time distractions. Why do you think OSS projects die?"
"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Quanta grows the project management demands are "
"increasing and ironically impacting the revenue stream it requires to continue. "
"The impact of our sponsored developers has been huge! We are looking to make "
"Quanta grow even faster. Eric needs to be able to free even more time to bring "
"several new and exciting ideas through coding to release. We have other "
"expenses too, with conferences and keeping our systems up to date so we don't "
"lose time fighting old hardware. <i>We want to make Quanta the best web tool "
"anywhere!</i>. This will require a nucleus of active core developers. We hope "
"professional developers and companies using Quanta will help us to reach our "
"goals with sponsorship donations that will relieve financial stresses.\n"
"<div align=\"center\">"
"<h3>Could Quanta die without your support?</h3></div>"
"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'd like to think not! But from February 2001 to June "
"2002 there was very little activity and many months with no work done at all. "
"This came about because of cash flow problems which led to the original "
"developers leaving to do a commercial project. The fact remains that our most "
"productive volunteer developers, as much as we think they're wonderful, go long "
"periods where they just can't make time to code on the project. We estimate our "
