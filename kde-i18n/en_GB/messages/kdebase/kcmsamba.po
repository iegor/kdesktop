"The Samba and NFS Status Monitor is a front end to the programs <em>"

"connections, and is part of the suite of Samba tools, which implements the SMB "
"(Session Message Block) protocol, also called the NetBIOS or LanManager "
"protocol. This protocol can be used to provide printer sharing or drive sharing "
"services on a network including machines running the various flavors of "
"Microsoft Windows."
