"<h1>Login Manager</h1> In this module you can configure the various aspects of "
"the KDE Login Manager. This includes the look and feel as well as the users "
"that can be selected for login. Note that you can only make changes if you run "
"the module with superuser rights. If you have not started the KDE Control "
"Centre with superuser rights (which is absolutely the right thing to do, by the "
"way), click on the <em>Modify</em> button to acquire superuser rights. You will "
"be asked for the superuser password."
"<h2>Appearance</h2> On this tab page, you can configure how the Login Manager "
"should look, which language it should use, and which GUI style it should use. "
"The language settings made here have no influence on the user's language "
"settings."
"<h2>Font</h2>Here you can choose the fonts that the Login Manager should use "
"for various purposes like greetings and user names. "
"<h2>Background</h2>If you want to set a special background for the login "
"screen, this is where to do it."
"<h2>Shutdown</h2> Here you can specify who is allowed to shutdown/reboot the "
"machine and whether a boot manager should be used."
"<h2>Users</h2>On this tab page, you can select which users the Login Manager "
"will offer you for logging in."
"<h2>Convenience</h2> Here you can specify a user to be logged in automatically, "
"users not needing to provide a password to log in, and other convenience "
"features."
"<br>Note, that these settings are security holes by their nature, so use them "
"very carefully."
