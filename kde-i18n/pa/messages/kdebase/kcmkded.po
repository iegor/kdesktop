"<p>This module allows you to have an overview of all plugins of the KDE Daemon, "

"<ul>"
"<li>Services invoked at startup</li>"
"<li>Services called on demand</li></ul>"
"<p>The latter are only listed for convenience. The startup services can be "

"services should be loaded at startup.</p>"
"<p><b> Use this with care: some services are vital for KDE; do not deactivate "
