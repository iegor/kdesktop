"<h1>Printers</h1>The KDE printing manager is part of KDEPrint which is the "
"interface to the real print subsystem of your Operating System (OS). Although "
"it does add some additional functionality of its own to those subsystems, "
"KDEPrint depends on them for its functionality. Spooling and filtering tasks, "
"especially, are still done by your print subsystem, or the administrative tasks "
"(adding or modifying printers, setting access rights, etc.)"
"<br/> What print features KDEPrint supports is therefore heavily dependent on "
"your chosen print subsystem. For the best support in modern printing, the KDE "
"Printing Team recommends a CUPS based printing system."
