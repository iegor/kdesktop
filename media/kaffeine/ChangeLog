(e.g.: kplayer, kaboodle) for playback, currently only the xine based
kaffeine part is full supported.
Note for developers: To create a part full supported by Kaffeine you have to
derive your part from the KMediaPart class (see
KDE_INLUDE_DIR/kaffeine/kmediapart.h) instead of KParts::ReadOnlyPart.
 * One (tabbed) window interface contains player, playlist and maybe more in
the future

statusbar

change from time to time; if playback of first entry fails, Kaffeine tries
the next without any error message

to the player; fixes problems with xine's VCD plugin, special characters
like "?" and " @" in local files and password proctected hosts

 * Embedded in a konqueror frame: full given space is now used for video
window; playback control via right-click context menu
