This directory contains the player parts (aka backends) for kaffeine.

It consists of the following subdirectories:

- kaffeine-part
  The base for all player parts. Every player part is derived from the
  "KaffeinePart" class and reimplements functions. Additionally kaffeine-part
  provides functions for embedding the player part e.g. into browsers.

- dummy-part
  An empty part which you can use to create a new player part.

- xine-part
  This is the default (and recommended) player part for kaffeine using xine-lib.

- gstreamer-part
  This is an experimental player part using GStreamer.
