Qinx, Version 1.x
=================

Qinx is a look and feel for KDE that includes a widget style, window
decoration, and color schemes. It resembles the look and feel of the QNX Photon
desktop. Inspiration for this style came from similar styles by Derek Greene
<del@chek.com>, David Reveman <c99drn@cs.umu.se>, and of course, QNX Software
Systems.

The Qinx widget style is built as a KDE plugin, but is also useful for stand
alone Qt programs provided that the KDE libraries are installed.

Please read the INSTALL file for installation instructions. You can activate
the style, decoration and color schemes through the KDE Control Center.

Please note that this version of Qinx is for KDE 3.2 and above. It will not
build or run under KDE 3.1 and earlier.

The Qinx homepage is at <http://www.usermode.org/code.html>.
